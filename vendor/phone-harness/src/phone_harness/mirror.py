    The typed text stays on the Mac clipboard afterwards. Restoring the
    previous contents was a race: the phone pulls the clipboard through the
    Mirroring session some unknown time after cmd+v, and nothing reports
    when it has — restore too early and the phone pastes what was on the
    clipboard BEFORE (a URL, a token, a password) into the field. A
    deterministic "your clipboard now holds what was typed" beats a
    sometimes-leak. Set ios.restore_clipboard=true in config to restore
    after a generous settle anyway (ios.paste_settle seconds).
