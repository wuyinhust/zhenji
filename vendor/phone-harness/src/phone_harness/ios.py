"""iOS backend: the op vocabulary over iPhone Mirroring.

An adapter, not a rewrite. mirror.py and background.py keep their shape and are
imported as they are — they hold the details that were expensive to learn (why
NSWorkspace's frontmost value is a constant, why a slow drag barely registers
on iOS, why the live phone image is opaque to accessibility) and none of that
should move just to change the seam above it.

What iPhone Mirroring cannot do appears here as absence rather than emulation:

  no `nav.back`      iOS has no system Back button. Guessing at an edge swipe
                     returns something the caller cannot tell from a real Back.
  no `apps.current`  the window exposes no app inventory; the foreground app is
  no `apps.list`     only knowable by reading the screen.
  no `tree`          the phone image is a video stream, which is the whole
                     reason screen.text has to recognise glyphs.
  no `raw`           there is no single command channel the way adb is one. The
                     substrate is Quartz: `import Quartz` in your own script,
                     or reach through this backend's .mirror module.

Each raises Unsupported, so a caller can ask rather than discover it by
getting a plausible wrong answer.
