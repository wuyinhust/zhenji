"""The one seam every device sits behind.

A backend implements a single method — send(op, **kw) — over the op vocabulary
below. Ops are named for what they MEAN, never for how a platform does them,
which is what lets helpers.py carry no platform knowledge at all: `nav.home`
means the same thing to an iPhone and a Pixel, though one is a Cmd+1 keystroke
into a video stream and the other is a KEYCODE_HOME over adb.

This mirrors browser-harness, where helpers.py has no idea whether the browser
is local or in the cloud because everything funnels through cdp(). Phones have
no shared wire protocol to funnel through — SkyLight event records and adb have
nothing in common — so the shared layer is this vocabulary instead.

    screen.capture      path=None       -> (png_path, bounds)
    screen.bounds                       -> {x, y, w, h, id} or None
    screen.require                      -> bounds, or raise
    screen.text         min_confidence  -> [{text, confidence, source, x, y, w, h}]
    screen.text_pixels  min_confidence  -> same, forced through pixel OCR

        screen.text is the load-bearing op. iOS answers with Vision OCR over a
        capture; a device with an accessibility tree answers from the tree.
        Same contract, same coordinate space, very different fidelity, so each
        box carries `source`: "pixels" means a recogniser inferred it and may
        have misread, "tree" means the OS reported it exactly. It has to be an
        explicit field — Vision returns confidence 1.0 for clean text just as a
        tree does, so confidence cannot tell them apart.

    input.tap           x, y
    input.press         x, y, duration              long press
    input.drag          x1, y1, x2, y2, duration, steps
    input.scroll        x, y, dy, steps             +dy scrolls content up
    input.keys          combo
    input.text          s, delay, keystrokes

        input.text pastes by default, which is exact; keystrokes=True asks for
        real key events instead. The distinction is in the vocabulary because
        it changes what arrives: a keystroke path runs through the device's own
        autocorrect and keyboard layout, a paste does not. Backends without a
        shared clipboard may only support keystrokes.

        duration and steps stay in the vocabulary rather than being hidden. On
        iOS a fast short drag is a momentum flick and a slow one barely
        registers; over adb the same knob decides whether a list flings past
        rows between captures. Abstracting it away would cost behaviour.

    nav.home / nav.back / nav.recents
    apps.launch  name -> app id
    apps.current      -> app id or None
    apps.list    include_system=False -> [app id]

        Unsupported where the concept does not exist, rather than emulated.
        iPhone Mirroring has no system Back button and exposes no app
        inventory; Android has no Spotlight. A fake Back that guesses at an
        edge swipe returns a result the caller cannot tell from a real one.

    session.state                       -> backend-defined string, 'ready' when usable
    session.require                     -> bounds, or raise telling the USER what to do
    session.refocus                     -> None    (a no-op where nothing needs focus)
    session.detail                      -> str, why the session is unusable

    focus.probe                         -> opaque snapshot
    focus.diff          before, after   -> {raised, stole_focus}

        Whether driving the phone disturbed whatever the user was doing. Two
        separate questions on purpose: taking keyboard focus is a mild
        annoyance, covering the screen is not, and a backend that reaches the
        device directly does neither.

    tree                                -> [node]   where the device has one
    raw                 ...             backend-specific escape hatch

Anything a backend genuinely cannot do raises Unsupported. Callers gate on
supports(op) rather than guessing.
